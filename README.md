# MICROSOFT' S NEW MOVIE STUDIO STRATEGY


This project is for Microsoft. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies.

Objectives:
1.  Explore what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office.
2.  Translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.
